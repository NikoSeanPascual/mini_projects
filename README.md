# Three Mini Projects I made while experimenting with python
- Dice Rolling: Pretty straight forward it's a code that basically prints out 2 dice and there randomize possible outcome from 1-6
- Number Guessing: A simple Game that makes you guess number 1-10 and not only that the code gives you hint if your higher or lower than the Correct number and you only have 5 guesses
- Minecraft: A severely simple Minecraft like game that is pretty buggy, as I made it by just experimenting
  
## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download `mini_projects`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing `dice_rolling.py`, `number_guessing.py`, `ursina_minecraft.py`.
3. Run the program:

# Must Have
